    "We can observe that since $f$ is a contraction, the sequence $y_n := x_{n+1} - x_{n}$ is a Cauchy sequence. Indeed, for all $n$ we have $d(y_{n+1}, y_{n}) \\leq L \\cdot d(y_n, y_{n-1})$ and therefore $lim_n d(y_{n+1}, y_{n}) =  0$ since $0 < L < 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$(\\mathcal{D},d)$ is a complete space, therefore every Cauchy sequence in $\\mathcal{D}$ converges. Thus there exists $x \\in \\mathcal{D}$ such that $x_n$ converges to $x$. By definition, this point satisfies $f(x) = x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, this point has to be unique since if there existed a second fixed-point $y$ not equal to $x$, then $ d(x,y) = d(f(x)-f(y)) \\leq L d(x,y) < d(x,y)$ which would be absurd. Therefore $x$ is the unique fixed-point of $f$."
